# Snake game using C++
I created a snake game using C++, without the use of any graphics library.<br>
To see how this games looks and work- https://youtu.be/HlmdeXelTsM <br>
I used following libraries-<br>
<ol>
<li>conio.h
<li> time.h 
<li> synchapi.h 
<li> windows.h 
 </ol>

The code snake.cpp is final game consists of all features, which is too efficient and its speed is great (you can't play custom: 0 ), it doesn't have screen flickering issues, the size of board can be increased without compromising the effciency of game.<br><br>Features-<br>

<ul>
<li> Various difficulty mode- Easy, Medium(Default), Hard, Custom(set the time in milliseconds)
<li> P can pause the game
<li> S can open the settings of game in exit screen or in welcome screen.
<li> C can end the game
<li> esc is used to exit the game at exit screen
<li> It has many settings to modify the game.
<li> Can pass though walls(modify in settings)(Default- No)
<li> Can go reverse(modify in settings)(Default- No)
<li> Can't die by touching its own body(modify in settings)(Default- No)
<li> Change the dimensions of board(modify in settings)(Default- 27 118)
<li> Two modes- Board can be made up of colours or of characters(modify in settings)(Default- Colour)
 </ul>
The other code snake_naive.cpp is the naive approach to this game, which I formed initially, it overwrites the whole screen and then writes it, then clears then writes it, so its not so efficient, slow but has a smaller code(almost half).
