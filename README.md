# Snake game using C++
I created a snake game using C++, without the use of any graphics library.<br>
To see how this games looks and work- https://youtu.be/wUurtgaCA7w <br>
I used following libraries-<br>
#include<iostream><br>
#include<vector><br>
#include<conio.h><br>
#include<time.h><br>
#include<synchapi.h><br>
#include<algorithm><br>
#include <windows.h><br>
  <br>
The code snake.cpp show symbols to represent snake, food, borders, whereas the snake_color.cpp uses colours to show all of them.<br>
Features-
1. It has 3 difficulty options
2. P can pause the game.
3. C can end the game without dying
4. All other basic rules of classic snake applies.
