# Snake game using C++
I created a snake game using C++, without the use of any graphics library.<br>
To see how this games looks and work- https://youtu.be/wUurtgaCA7w <br>
I used following libraries-<br>
1. conio.h
2. time.h <br>
3. synchapi.h <br>
3. windows.h <br>
  <br>
The code snake.cpp show symbols to represent snake, food, borders, whereas the snake_color.cpp uses colours to show all of them.<br>
Features-<br>
1. It has 3 difficulty options<br>
2. P can pause the game<br>
3. C can end the game without dying<br>
4. All other basic rules of classic snake applies<br>
