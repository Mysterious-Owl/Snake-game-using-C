# Snake game using C++
I created a snake game using C++, without the use of any graphics library.
To see how this games looks and work- https://youtu.be/wUurtgaCA7w
I used following libraries-
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<conio.h>
#include<time.h>
#include<synchapi.h>
#include<algorithm>
#include <windows.h>
  
 the code snake.cpp show symbols to represent snake, food, borders, whereas the snake_color uses colours to show all of them.
features-
1. It has 3 difficulty options
2. P can pause the game.
3. C can end the game without dying
4. All other basic rules of classic snake applies.
